# Address Book CLI

A command-line-based address book application built in C++ that allows users to manage contacts by adding, removing, searching, and displaying them. Each contact includes **First Name**, **Other Names**, **Email Address**, **Phone Number**, and **Address** (Street, Town, Country). The application ensures email and phone numbers are unique, and persists data between sessions by saving to a file.

## üöÄ Features

- **Add Contact**: Add a new contact, with all fields validated and email/phone numbers required to be unique.
- **Remove Contact**: Remove a contact using their email address. The removal process can be cancelled if needed.
- **Search Contact**: Search by:
  - First Name
  - Other Names
  - Email Address
  - Phone Number
  - Town
  - Country
- **Display All Contacts**: Lists all contacts in a table format.
- **File Persistence**: Saves contacts to `addressbook.txt` when the program exits, and loads them back on startup.
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Memory leak detection enabled via CRT for development.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AddressBook.cpp     # Main C++ file containing all logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ addressbook.txt     # File where contacts are saved and loaded from
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This README file
```

## üîß Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **C++11** or higher
- **g++** or any C++ compiler
- (Optional) **Visual Studio** for memory leak detection in debug mode

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o addressbook AddressBook.cpp
```

### Running

After compiling, run the program:

```bash
./addressbook
```

### Debug Mode (Memory Leak Detection)

For debugging purposes, memory leak detection is enabled. This works in environments like Visual Studio and helps ensure efficient memory management.

## üìù Input Validation

- **Email**: Must contain an `@` and a valid domain.
- **Phone Number**: Must be numeric and between 7-15 characters. It must also be unique.
- **Required Fields**: First name, other names, street, town, and country must all be non-empty.
- **Case Insensitivity**: All inputs are normalized to lowercase for consistent searching and matching.

## ‚ö° Key Highlights

1. **Unique Email and Phone**: Both email and phone numbers are enforced as unique to ensure data integrity.
2. **Robust Input Validation**: Prevents invalid inputs, empty fields, and skips.
3. **Efficient Searching**: The use of multiple indexes (for first name, phone, etc.) enables faster lookups.
4. **Persistent Data**: Contacts are saved to `addressbook.txt` on exit and loaded back when the program starts.
5. **Memory Management**: Memory leaks are detected and debugged using `_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks()` in development.

## üîç Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Duplicate Handling**
   - **Problem**: Preventing duplicate email and phone entries.
   - **Solution**: Added checks using `EmailExists` and `PhoneExists` to ensure both fields remain unique.

### 2. **Infinite Loops on Invalid Input**
   - **Problem**: The program was entering infinite loops if invalid input (like `1 2 3`) was provided.
   - **Solution**: Replaced input handling with robust validation and `do-while` loops.

### 3. **Case Insensitivity**
   - **Problem**: Searching was case-sensitive.
   - **Solution**: All inputs are converted to lowercase using `ToLower` for uniform case-insensitive comparisons.

### 4. **Ensuring Non-Empty Fields**
   - **Problem**: Users could accidentally leave fields blank.
   - **Solution**: Required fields like first name, other names, street, etc., are validated to ensure they are not left empty.

### 5. **Phone and Email Uniqueness**
   - **Problem**: Users could add contacts with the same phone number or email.
   - **Solution**: Email and phone number uniqueness is strictly enforced with relevant checks.

### 6. **Exit Mechanism in Removal**
   - **Problem**: Users couldn't cancel the removal process once started.
   - **Solution**: Added the option to type `'exit'` to cancel the operation during removal.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

If more time was available, the following improvements would be considered:

1. **Wildcard Search**: Allow partial or wildcard-based searches.
2. **Pagination**: For better user experience when listing large numbers of contacts.
3. **International Phone Number Support**: Handle international formats and validation.
4. **Enhanced File Format**: Switch to a more structured data format (JSON, XML) for better data integrity and flexibility.
5. **Recent Searches**: Implement a history of recent search terms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

- **Standard C++ STL** (`<unordered_map>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`) ‚Äì Used for fast lookups, storage, and handling large datasets.
- **CRT Debugging** (`<crtdbg.h>`) ‚Äì Enabled memory leak detection in development environments.
